# Terminal

We need a terminal emulator for the GUI.

`foot` looks excellent but it's only in the AUR for now.

Two alternatives:

* ~~`termite`~~ is dead!
* `alacritty`

`pacman -S --needed alacritty`

(note: this installs some X dependencies.)

## Alacritty

Select text: `<ctrl>-<shift>-<space>`

* v character
* alt-v (semantic)
* shift-v (line)
* ctrl-v (block)
* y - copy selection

Search text: ctrl-shift-f, ctrl-shift-b
