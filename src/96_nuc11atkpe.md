## UEFI

Set the harddrive start pre-delay to zero (it is pointless).

### UEFI Lockdown Mode

Consult the manual to change the jumper to lock down the UEFI.

No POST hotkeys (F2 for setup; F10 for boot menu).
No power button menu.

### UEFI Update

Download the .cab file from the Intel Website, place on to a USB stick, and
press F7 on power-up to enter the UEFI update menu.


## Power Consumption

* **Base + WiFi** 3.0 W
* **Keyboard** +0.2 W
* **Mouse** +0.4 W
* **HDMI** +1.5 W
* **Syncthing** +2.5-3.5 W (when actively syncing)
* **CPU Stress Test** 25.5 W

The base power consumption is with a plain Arch Linux installation with many
UEFI features turned off except WiFi which is connected to a network. In
particular, the Bluetooth, SATA port, VT-d, and TPM features are disabled

I have not tested disabling WiFi, or with the Ethernet port.

There is no difference between USB2 and USB3 power consumption for peripherals.

There is no difference to power consumption whether the monitor is switched to
the HDMI input or not so long as it is connected.

The overall power consumption with all of the above plugged in was 5.3 W which
is slightly higher than the sum of the individual components due to rounding.

Thus using the NUC in headless mode saves ~Â£7/year with 2022 electricity prices
of 0.39 p/kWh.
