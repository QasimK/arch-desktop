# AUR

Don't bother with AUR tools unless you have so many packages.

A lot of them need `sudo`, and we're avoiding that :)

Use <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/paru/>.

Download the binary directly from GitHub and use it to install itself :)

Install `binutils` for `strip`.

Run `makepkg -sirc`.
